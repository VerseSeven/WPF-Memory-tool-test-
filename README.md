# WPF Memory Hacker

This is a simple WPF-based memory tool built to help understand how computer memory works in Windows applications.  
It can read and (eventually) modify memory values of other processes using system calls like `NtReadVirtualMemory`.

This project is for **educational purposes only**, especially for those learning how to scan memory, understand memory layouts, and work with processes safely.

---

## 📌 Features

- Process scanning (by name)
- Read integers from external memory using syscalls
- Simple structure for adding your own tools (health locks, aimbot logic, overlays, etc.)
- Safe for offline or test environments

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2022 or newer
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later

### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/WPF-Memory-Hacker.git
````

2. Open the solution file:

   ```
   WPF Memory Hacker.sln
   ```

3. Set the build configuration to **Debug** or **Release**, then hit `F5` to run.

4. Test it with your own offline game or test application (e.g., one with a known health value like `int health = 100;`).

## 🔍 Tips for Learning

* Try using **Cheat Engine** first to find basic values (like health) in a test app.
* Use this tool to practice scanning and freezing those values externally.
* Look into how anti-cheats work to understand what *not* to do.
* Keep everything **offline** and for practice only.

### ✅ Realistic Tone Summary:
- It avoids robotic or overly professional tone.
- Speaks like a dev: honest, straightforward, no overpromising.
- It's GitHub-safe, educational, and has a **clear boundary** on what's allowed.

Would you like a matching `README_CODE.md` that explains how your `MemoryHelper`, `HealthHack`, etc., work internally? Or should I package this `README.md` in a downloadable `.txt` or `.md` file for you?
